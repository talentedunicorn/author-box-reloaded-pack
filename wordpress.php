******************************************

HOW TO:

Change the following at top:

	1. At top the the specific text portion in "Plugin Name", i.e in case of "Wordpress.Org" this is the text to change
	2. At top change the "Author", "Author URI" and "Donate Link" by your owns. 

Change the following below:

    1. The function name but keep the "_authorbox_add_sites" portion.
		a) We usually use the name text for it, i.e. for "Wordpress.Org" you'll set "wordpress_org" or something like it.
    2. The $known_sites key and the "favicon" and "url" variables: 
		a) The key is used in the profile form so use the same text you used in the Plugin Name in header area.
        b) Don't forget that the $known_site url must have the text "USERNAME" in it in order to work properly.
	3. Change the values for  "plugin->author", "plugin->url" and "plugin->donate".
    4. Change the add_filter() function to include your "_authorbox_add_sites" function.

To make it available to everyone follow the rules defined at [Wordpress.Org](http://http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/).
This is just another Wordpress plugin that will made some data available for Author Box Reloaded.

Thank you for your help and contribution.
